# challenge-5

This challenge goal was to create a planner.
The planner was supposed to be interactive and responsive.
I faced challenges with forcing the boxes to change colors and to make the local storage retain information, because this assignment was pastdue I chose to make the hard decision to turn in the assignment without it being completely functional.
